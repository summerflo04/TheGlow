 The Glow Time Capsule Challenge
🧠 Overview
You’ve been selected to help preserve the essence of this era for the year 2100.
Your mission is to design an application — both frontend and backend — where three fictional characters each contribute 10 items to a digital time capsule. You will choose who these characters are, define their attributes, and decide what artifacts from today’s world they feel are worth preserving for future generations.
This is both a creative exercise and a technical challenge — and we’re excited to see your take.
⏱️ Ideally please spend no more than 2 hours on this assignment (really, we don’t want this to be too much work for you)
 📅 Final submission is due one week from the day it’s sent to you

🧾 Your Objectives
Design 3 unique characters.
 Each character should have a name, personality traits, and any attributes you think are interesting.
Each character must add 10 items to a shared time capsule.
 These items can be websites, quotes, videos, memes, inventions, news articles, tech products, cultural moments, or anything else they’d choose.
Build a frontend and backend application that lets a user:
See the 3 characters and their capsule items.


Explore the items added by each character.


Use a local database and build a backend server:
You may use any backend language and framework you like.


You must model the characters and their items in your database.


Serve the data from your backend to your frontend.


Make it feel alive.
Feel free to get weird, futuristic, funny, or sincere.


Your app can be simple or expressive — go wild with the presentation if you want.
